0x1D. C - Binary trees

This projects covers the concepts of binary trees! 
At the end of this project, I was able to undesrtand these questions that were my learning objectives:

Learning Objectives
	1. What is a binary tree?
	2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree?
	3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists?
	4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree?
	5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?
	6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree?
